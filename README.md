# Meta-Analysis: Microbiome in Diabetes & Alzheimer’s

## 📌 Project Overview
This project performs a meta-analysis of microbiome datasets to investigate shared and distinct microbial signatures in Diabetes Mellitus and Alzheimer’s Disease.  
It integrates statistical analysis with machine learning to identify potential microbial biomarkers, followed by biological interpretation using pathway and functional enrichment analysis.

## 🎯 Objectives
- Integrate microbiome datasets from multiple studies.
- Identify microbial taxa associated with each disease.
- Apply machine learning classification to distinguish conditions.
- Perform pathway and functional analysis for biological insights.

## 🛠️ Tech Stack
- **Languages:** Python (Pandas, NumPy, Scikit-learn), R (phyloseq, vegan)
- **Bioinformatics Tools:** QIIME2, LEfSe
- **Visualization:** Matplotlib, Seaborn, ggplot2
